- add support for grayscale images.
- add ability to resume training from checkpoint
- address performance issue in generate.py
- add support for arbitrary dataset resolutions
- incorporate tricks recomended in soumith/ganhacks:
	- ~~1: Normalize the inputs~~
	- 2: A modified loss function
	- 3: Use a spherical Z
	- ~~4: BatchNorm~~
	- ~~5: Avoid Sparse Gradients: ReLU, MaxPool~~
	- 6: Use Soft and Noisy Labels
	- 7: DCGAN / Hybrid Models
	- 8: Use stability tricks from RL
	- 9: ~~Use the ADAM Optimizer~~
	- 10: Track failures early
	- 11: Dont balance loss via statistics (unless you have a good reason to)
	- 12: If you have labels, use them
	- 13: Add noise to inputs, decay over time
	- 16: Discrete variables in Conditional GANs
	- 17: Use Dropouts in G in both train and test phase
